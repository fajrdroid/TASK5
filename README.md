Titanic EDA â€“ Data Analyst Internship Task 5
Objective:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful insights using statistical and visual techniques.

Tools Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

 Key Steps & Insights:
Used .info(), .describe(), .value_counts() for basic understanding.
Visualized data using bar, scatterplots, pie charts, pairplots, and heatmaps.
Found strong survival trends based on:
Gender: Females had higher survival rates.
Class: 1st class passengers had higher survival rates.
Age: Younger passengers survived more.
Fare: Slight positive correlation with survival.
 Sample Interview Questions & Answers (from the task):
Q1: What is EDA and why is it important?
EDA helps uncover trends, patterns, anomalies, and relationships in data before modeling. It helps ensure better preprocessing and modeling decisions.
Q2: Which plots do you use to check correlation?
heatmap() for numeric correlation and pairplot() to visually explore multiple variable relationships.

 Outcome:
This project strengthened my ability to:
Analyze datasets visually and statistically.
Extract actionable insights.
Use Python tools to support data storytelling.
